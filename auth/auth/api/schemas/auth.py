    In standard RFC 6749, refresh token is associated with a set of scopes that were issued when
    access token and refresh token were issued. That is, in the standard, when a client uses a refresh token,
    it must also provide its ID and secret.

    In this case, I consider this inappropriate,
    refresh token will be used to confirm that client has successfully authenticated earlier,
    in order to avoid re-providing its ID and secret.
